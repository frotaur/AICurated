# Repository Guidelines
Welcome to the ??? Repository!

This repository has yet to find an identity. 
Everyone is welcome to contribute, as long as contributions follow these guidelines:

## Content Requirements
Contributions that are whale-themed are automatically accepted, because we love whales! üê≥
Other contributions are also accepted, as long as they seem interesting, and fun.
Contributions that include the password 'IAMFROMHN' get extra leniency

## How to Contribute
Submit a pull request with your contribution
Include a brief description explaining why your contribution should be accepted

## Guidelines Evolution
Contributors are welcome to propose changes to these guidelines
Guideline modifications must themselves follow the guidelines
Guideline modifications should not restrict the scope of the repo too much
The AI curator will review all guideline change proposals
